## Understanding Deployment Protection by environment
Understanding Deployment Protection by environment
You can configure the type of Deployment Protection for each environment in your project depending on your projects security needs. When choosing your protection method, you can select from three options:
- Standard Protection: This option protects all domains except [Production Custom Domains](https://vercel.com/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain). Standard Protection is available on all plans
- All Deployments: Protects all URLs. Protecting all deployments is available on Pro and Enterprise plans
- (Legacy) Standard Protection: This option protects all preview URLs and deployment URLs. All [up to date production URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls) are unprotected.
- (Legacy) Only Preview Deployments: This option protects only preview URLs. This does not protect past production deployments.
