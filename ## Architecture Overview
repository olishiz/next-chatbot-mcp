## Architecture Overview

The MCP Inspector consists of two main components that work together:
- MCP Inspector Client (MCPI): A React-based web UI that provides an interactive interface for testing and debugging MCP servers
- MCP Proxy (MCPP): A Node.js server that acts as a protocol bridge, connecting the web UI to MCP servers via various transport methods (stdio, SSE, streamable-http)
Note that the proxy is not a network proxy for intercepting traffic. Instead, it functions as both an MCP client (connecting to your MCP server) and an HTTP server (serving the web UI), enabling browser-based interaction with MCP servers that use different transport protocols.
